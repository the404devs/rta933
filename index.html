                  In <i>Time/Traveller: Bacteria Bruxa</i>, author Shaina Agbayani strings together a short, reflective commentary on fermentation by drawing on her own cultural identity. Agbayani explores fermentation as more than just a culinary practice, painting it as a spiritual and cultural ritual allowing for a connection with one's land and ancestors. Agbayani's narrative highlights the fermentation process as a microcosm of society: drawing comparisons between the commercialization of probiotics and the processes of colonialism. She suggests fermentation as a small way to disengage from the machine of capitalism, heal, and reconnect with one's traditions and culture.

                  "I am reminded here of the power of community in creating immunity and protection when we come together with intention, integrity, patience and ritual to honour place-based relationships."

                <span style="margin:10px">
                  This particular quote sticks out to me, as a long-term resident of a town struggling to keep its own identity and sense of place. Agbayani is referring to the bacteria within sourdough, and it's ability to become self-sustaining and insular against outside threats. Continuing with the piece's overarching theme of bacterial cultures as a miniature mirror of human society, I draw a comparison here to real-world community spirit and the age-old idea of "it takes a village to raise a child". My own hometown has grown subtantially over my lifetime, and I've witnessed a decline of community engagement as the population bloomed and demographics shifted. Traditions are dying out, and people are growing distant from one another. This quote, and the article as a whole, serve as a reminder that there's more to a village than just a bunch of people in one area: communities need to be guided and nurtured in order to foster a sense of place and belonging. All in all, it's not too different from dumping a bunch of flour in a jar to create sourdough: without care and nurturing, it will never grow.

                    Starter #1 displayed some bubbles, but had not risen very much. It's consistency was thick, and I suspect it didn't recieve enough water the previous day. After splitting and feeding it, I turned the discard into a second starter and fed that one as well.

                    Both starters rose significantly overnight, to about double their volume. Neither displayed many bubbles on the surface, but when stirred they had very light and airy insides. In terms of colour, both had a darker crust on the top, but were much brighter inside. After feeding starters #1 & #2, both were split off into new starters, leaving me with 4.

                    After a warm night above the fireplace, the 4 starters rose massively, tripling their volume. Lots of bubbles were visible in the jars, and they were incredibly thick and hard to stir. Once again, the discard from the 4 starters became another 4, leaving me with 8.

                    Not much activity was observed overnight. The starters didn't rise much, and most were a bit more runny than usual. I have run out of jars at this point, so I can only afford to split off 2 new ones. Those that get split off are fed and watered, while the rest get a good stir. Caring for 10 starters is getting time-consuming.

                    Again, the starters failed to rise much overnight. Starter #1 and some of the others showed a fair bit of bubbling, and most were quite runny.
                    Most starters got a good stir, while Starter #1 and 2 others were fed and watered.

                    The original starter rose a fair bit, with a lot of bubbles. It was the runniest it's been yet, and many of the other starters had some interesting results.
